#SimuVest 
**The user-friendly investment simulator. **

SimuVest was created with the aim of helping newcomers become more confident in their investing skills and helping relatively inexperienced investors try out new investment strategies without risking their investments. 

We use a proprietary algorithm to retrieve and analyse stock data using yfinance. This data is continually stored, updated and tracked in a MongoDB cluster, from where frontend allows the user to create their own stock indices. 
The growth of these indices is charted and analysed using NumPy, and a brief visual summary is displayed for the user.
